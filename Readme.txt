Feel free to use this open-source code. But please, quote my repository if you did so ;)


How to use it :

Required :
QT 5.0.1
VLC lib and include => Can be found on every VLC install
SFML 2 => http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.2/index-fr.php

Using :
 - Make sure that the folders "themes", "Emulators", "Roms" and "users" are two folders over the binary eg : C:/Core/Litchi/Litchi.exe and C:/Emulators
 - If you want to add some emulators or roms, the name must be the name of the kind of emulator. eg : C:/Emulators/Nes and C:/Roms/Nes/
 - If you want to add another icon theme, it must be like the default "Litchi theme", same name (shutdown.png, etc) and same size (150*150px) => svg will come later
 - Wallpapers can be of any size

Excuse me for some of my mistakes. As it was my first projet (I learn C++ to this project !!), it's not really optimized, but I will improve it when I have time =)

Enjoy !!
It works like a charm on a Raspberry B+
